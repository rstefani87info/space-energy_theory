# Space-Energy Theory  
### A reinterpretation of mass and time as local effects of entropy and condensed energy
## Fundamental Postulates
- Mass is a local manifestation of energy condensed in space, mediated by $\tau$.
- $\tau$ represents an entropic-temporal coefficient dependent on the frequency of energy transitions representing time not as an absolute quantity, but a function of entropic variation.
- Three-dimensional space is geometric and continuous, and does not deform.
- Wave functions are the description of changes in matter configuration in terms of frequency, density dictated by the energy undergone and intrinsic to the system.

The Space-Energy Theory proposes that mass emerges from energy condensed in three-dimensional space, regulated by entropic variations. It replaces quantum wave functions with entropic transitions, seeking to unify space, energy, entropy and time in a single coherent theoretical framework.

## 1. Introduction

One of the great objectives of contemporary physics is to build a bridge between the three main descriptions of reality: Newton's classical mechanics, Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics. Despite notable theoretical and experimental successes in each field, their integration remains one of the unsolved problems of modern science.

>***Observation*** - We are accustomed to considering the measurement of a system from the outside and therefore we have an objective point of view to affirm that the values are real; we primarily and our instruments are not subject to the conditions of the system itself, at most they *contaminate* it with a margin of error. When we talk about universe, space, time, gravity and energy we are inside it and we cannot isolate ourselves and we too vary with the system!

A fundamental question therefore arises: **what if the problem derived from our point of view?**

- We treat time as a fundamental quantity, but we know that it varies with the curvature of spacetime induced by gravity. Therefore we can no longer consider it absolute.
- The vision of particles as fundamental building blocks of reality could be superseded. The Standard Model and the Higgs mechanism suggest that energy is the primary reality, from which matter emerges as structured condensation.

In light of this, we hypothesize that the only absolute quantities are **Space** (s) and **Energy** (E).

## 2. The intuition from Einstein's formula

Einstein provided us with the tool to calculate the energy contained in a system:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, constant in every local reference frame.

The Higgs mechanism interprets mass as an effect deriving from a quantum configuration: a particular energetic state of interaction with the Higgs field.

From here, we can make mass explicit in Einstein's formula as:

$$
m = \frac{E}{c^2}
$$

Now, considering velocity as the ratio between space and time:

$$
v = \frac{s}{T}
$$

and therefore $c^2 = (s/T)^2$, we obtain:

$$
m =  \frac{E{T}^2} {s^2}
$$

This reformulation opens to the possibility of considering **mass as a local effect of energy condensation in space, mediated by time (i.e., by the entropy of the system).**

## 3. The convention/lie of time

As mentioned, time has historically been considered a fundamental quantity, but in practice it is a convention based on an arbitrary reference: the hyperfine transition of the cesium atom.

More generally, we can interpret time as a measure of entropy variation:

$$
T = f(\Delta S)
$$

where:

- $\Delta S$ is the entropy variation,
- $T$ is the perceived time,
- $E$ is the energy of the system.

therefore:
> "$\tau$ represents the inverse of the frequency variation $\Delta f$, and is proportional to the order of the system: the greater the order (lower entropy), the smaller $\Delta f$, therefore the greater $\tau$"
---

### 3.1 Temporal curvature

In the practical case of atomic clocks, the hyperfine transition of cesium is sensitive to gravity. The frequency variation observed between two clocks at different altitudes confirms that time is not uniform, but **depends on the local entropic-energetic context**, i.e., on the curvature of spacetime.

We can describe this relationship as:

$$
 \tau = \frac{1}{\Delta f}
 = \frac{1} {\frac{1}{T_{g2}}-\frac{1}{T_{g1}}} = \frac{1} {\frac{\Delta T}{T_{g2}T_{g1}}}
$$

where $\Delta f$ is the frequency variation between two observers.

Therefore:

$$
\tau = \frac{T_{g2}T_{g1}}{\Delta T}
$$

---

### 3.2 Frequency variation: disordered time

The hyperfine transition of cesium is not just an arbitrary reference: it is a true indicator of the **energetic coherence** of a system. The variation of the gravitational field modifies the amount of energy necessary for a quantum transition (e.g. spin change), and this manifests as a frequency change.

This variation is, in all respects, an observable entropic manifestation.

---

### 3.3 Conclusions on time - *Law of variable time*

We can therefore hypothesize that in the curvature of spacetime **it is not the external perception that is distorted**, but it is the local reality that undergoes an objective variation.

Atomic clocks located at altitude, far from strong gravitational sources, measure a time that flows faster than those positioned at sea level. This difference **is not apparent, but real**.

However, a local observer within a gravitational field does not perceive any variation, since his instruments and his consciousness are also subject to the same energetic-entropic transformation.

We are therefore immersed in an **invisible but concrete curvature**, which modulates the manifestation of space, time and energy.

> **Law of variable time**: The time we measure is not an independent entity, but a local consequence of the energetic and entropic state of the system. **It is a convention structured on entropy.**
>
or we can say...

> **Law of variable time**: Time **is not an absolute quantity**, but a **convention** that follows **local physical laws**.

therefore we should replace time in Einstein's formula with $\tau$ as effective time measured from outside, we obtain:

$$
m = E \frac{\tau^2}{s^2}
$$

This formula suggests that mass is a **local** effect of spacetime curvature, mediated by time.

## 4. What happens to space

### 4.1 Space doesn't change: it's matter that compacts

One of the most common errors in describing space curvature is imagining that space itself "deforms" like an elastic fabric in two dimensions. This analogy, useful from a didactic point of view, is however misleading on the physical level.

According to the present theory, **three-dimensional space remains geometric and continuous**. Its metric structure does not modify "by itself", but what changes is **the matter that moves within it**, in response to intense gravitational fields.

> Space is the reference structure, but matter modifies its apparent dynamics for those who traverse it.  
> Curvature is an effect of **energy and density distribution** and manifests in the **geodesic** followed by matter and light.

#### Analogy: Matter in extreme gravity vs. White Dwarfs

| Aspect                         | Space-Energy Theory                    | White Dwarf (real astrophysics)                         |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Effect of gravity**       | Gravity condenses energy, reducing the space occupied by matter (atomic contraction) | Gravity compresses atoms until crushing electronic orbitals |
| **Space**                      | Remains geometric, continuous, unchanged    | Remains unchanged: it's matter that adapts to gravitational pressure |
| **Atomic radius**              | Reduces with increasing gravitational intensity | Electrons are "squeezed" towards the nucleus; atomic radius decreases |
| **Binding energy**          | Increases stability of quantum states | Electrons form a very stable degenerate gas      |
| **Entropy**                    | Entropy decreases locally with gravitational order | Low entropy state: electrons fill lower quantum levels |
| **Observable result**       | Mass increases with \( \frac{1}{s^2} \), but volume contracts | Very dense objects: solar mass in terrestrial volume   |
| **Limiting mechanism**           | Quantum condensation is regulated by τ (entropic coeff.) | When Chandrasekhar limit is exceeded → gravitational collapse |

### 4.2 Local perception remains invariant

An observer falling into an intense gravitational field, such as that near a neutron star or black hole, **does not perceive variations in his own local space**. This happens because:

- The acceleration towards the center of the field causes the relative velocity between observer and spatial coordinates to change continuously.
- But **the local measurement system** (for example, the meter and clock based on cesium) **contracts and slows down together with the observer**.
- Therefore, **the local space metric appears unchanged**, even if profound transformations are occurring with respect to an external observer.

---

### 4.3 Matter condenses: atomic radius variation

In the proposed model, **it is not space that compresses**, but it is **matter that modifies its internal structure**, in particular:
> Law of constant space: the space available in the system does not change, but mass contracts.

#### 4.3.1 Effect of gravity on quantum states

- In the presence of a strong gravitational field, gravitational potential energy enters the total balance of the atom.
- This **lowers the total energy of the system** and **shifts the energy minimum**, inducing **a contraction of the electronic distribution**.
- Consequently, **the ionic (or atomic) radius is reduced**.

#### 4.3.2 Formalization:
Assuming that the total energy of the atom is:

$$
E_{\text{tot}} = E_{\text{quantum}} + E_{\text{gravitational}}
$$

and that:

$$E_{\text{gravitational}} = - \frac{G M m}{r}$$

then, as the involved mass (M) increases and the radius (r) decreases, **the energy minimum is reached at a smaller distance**, and matter **condenses**.

---

### 4.4 Consequence on space-energy theory

In the context of the proposed theory, this compression can be integrated into the formula:

$$
m = E \cdot \frac{\tau^2}{s^2}
$$

Where:

- $s$ is the spatial dimension occupied by matter (e.g. atomic radius),
- $\tau$ is the entropic-temporal function, which in the presence of gravitational order **decreases**,
- $E$ is the energy of the system.

> As $s$ and $\tau$ decrease, the apparent mass **increases**, since more energy is condensed in a smaller volume.

---

### 4.5 Conclusion

> **Space remains invariant in its geometry, but matter changes quantum behavior under the effect of gravity.**  
> The result is a **real contraction of matter**, not of space, which however modifies **the perceived dynamics**, giving rise to effects attributed to curvature.

The "curvature" effect is therefore a **consequence of quantum condensation of matter** within a gravitational field, not a deformation of space itself. This principle allows reinterpreting many astrophysical phenomena in terms of condensed energy and entropy, without violating the geometric coherence of three-dimensional space.
